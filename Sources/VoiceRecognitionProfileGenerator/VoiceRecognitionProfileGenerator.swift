            This tool generates both VAC (https://www.dwvac.com) and VoiceAttack
            (https://voiceattack.com) profiles for voice recognition intended
            for use in video gaming. **VAC** is a simple voice recognition macro
            utility that recognizes voice commands and executes keyboard and
            mouse macros. VoiceAttack is similar to VAC but has much more complex
            macro tools. Both are intended for video gamers to allow hands-off
            control of their games.

            This script reads voice commands generated from a simple, easy-to-write
            nested domain-specific language (DSL). The DSL is optimized for games
            that use nested menus for generating commands that communicate with
            NPCs.
